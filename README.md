# UI Designs

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains my first set of UI design experiments created during my first week of learning UI/UX design.

## ðŸ§  What I'm Practicing

- Basic layout structure (e.g., homepage, login, profile pages)
- Visual hierarchy and spacing
- UI consistency and alignment
- Getting familiar with Figma and digital design tools

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Build strong UI/UX foundations
- Document my weekly progress
- Learn through practice and iteration

Stay tuned for more updates as I grow!
